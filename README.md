# Flutter Snowboy plugin

*This is alpha quality software. Caveat emptor!*

This repository contains the source code to the Flutter Snowboy package.
[Snowboy](https://github.com/seasalt-ai/snowboy) is a cross-platform
DNN-based hotword detection toolkit.

The plugin currently only supports the Android and iOS platforms.

## Models

The Flutter Snowboy package requires a working Snowboy detection
model (pmdl) to be useful. To train your own model, clone
[this repo](https://github.com/seasalt-ai/snowboy) and follow
the instructions.

## How to use

### Add dependency to project

Add this to the dependencies list in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
  flutter_snowboy: ">=0.1.0"
```

### Initialize detector

```dart
import 'package:flutter_snowboy/flutter_snowboy.dart';

...

// Instantiate
var detector = Snowboy();

// Load model and other resources.
// This is a moderately expensive operation since it involves file I/O.
var success = detector.prepare("/absolute/path/to/model.pmdl");

```

### Start

```dart
void hwHandler() {
    print("Hotword detected");
}

detector.hotwordHandler = hwHandler;

// ... get audio data as UInt8List and feed into detection function.

detector.detect(data);

// ... and hwHandler() gets called when the hotword is detected.
```
